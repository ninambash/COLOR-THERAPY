# Color Therapy
A board game for improving memory
# Game Pitch
Good memory is essential for independent living, staying focused and completing tasks.Research has now proven the link between the use of colors and improving memory. Color therapy uses colors that stimulate the limbic area of the brain, which deals with retention. This game is based on a book called Improving Memory Through Creativity by Amanda Pike, talks of a study on 91 older adults from different countries who were administered art therapy for 10 weeks. At the end of the study, the experimental group reported improved cognitive skills compared to the control group.
