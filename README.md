# Color Therapy

A board game that challenges your memory.<br>

# Game Pitch

Good memory is essential for independent living, staying focused and completing tasks.Research has now proven the link between the use of colors and improving memory. Color therapy uses colors that stimulate the limbic area of the brain, which deals with retention. This game is based on a book called Improving Memory Through Creativity by Amanda Pike, talks of a study on 91 older adults from different countries who were administered art therapy for 10 weeks. At the end of the study, the experimental group reported improved cognitive skills compared to the control group.

# potential roadblocks
Style the board to look nicer<br>

# approach taken
I started with a reviewing the topics I had learned, did some research about the game in mind.<br>
When i decided on the game, I wanted to focus on the interaction of the game to create a fun user experience.<br>
I proceeded to draft a wireframe to use it as a visual of my UI.<br>
I wrote a pseudocode of what I wanted to add to the game. <br>
I began the project using HTML, then added CSS and Javacripts.<br> 
I completed with gradually incrementing the functionality of the game testing and refrencing on my pseudocode and wireframe.<br>

#  Post-project reflection 
Target user was not properly represented. Focused on browser display as opposed to mobile display(media querries).<br>
This project solidified some concepts in JavaScript that were still bumpy<br>
Taking a break and come back with a fresh mind.<br>
